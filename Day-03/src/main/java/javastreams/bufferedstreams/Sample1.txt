FileReader

FileReader is useful to read data in the form of characters from a ‘text’ file.

This class inherited from the InputStreamReader Class.
The constructors of this class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer size are appropriate. To specify these values yourself, construct an InputStreamReader on a FileInputStream.
